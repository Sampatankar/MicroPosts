9/9: CRUD Frontend & Webpack with Babel

This is the final vanilla JavaScript project that takes in all the learning objectives of the Modern JS course by Brad Traversy, hosted on Udemy.com

This project deals with the entirety of working with JS on the front-end, links to the back-end (databases via JSON objects), and how to compile using NPM and Webpack.

This project will be compared to using React in the coming weeks.
